At 2 guard, however, he's undersized, which allows opposing 2 guards to muscle him up and score easily. I feel like a majority of the isolation plays on offense are Monta and Steph taking turns playing stellar one on one basketball, much like Lebron and Wade.

Let's look at relevant quotes, shall we?\\n\\n&gt;Golden State management is willing to take Howard as a one-season “rental,” with the hope of selling him on signing a long-term deal before he enters free agency this summer.\\n\\n&gt;Howard has told Orlando management that he would sign extensions with three teams – the Dallas Mavericks, Lakers and New Jersey Nets\\n\\nSo we already know FOR A FACT that Dwight would not sign an extension with the Warriors. Forget whatever Silicon Valley bullshit Lacob and Gruber are trying to sell him, why would he resign with the Warriors? So he can play on a shitty (and shittily-run, unless the new owners do something different soon) team that hasn't been anywhere since the 1970's? The Warriors offer no appeal to a superstar like Dwight who is in the prime of his career and would like to win a championship before he's too old. There is no way in hell that he would resign with us.\\n\\nSo now that we know for a fact Dwight Howard won't resign with us.\\n\\n&gt;For the Magic to become intrigued with package, two things would likely have to appeal to them: rebuilding around young point guard Stephen Curry; and the Warriors’ salary-cap space to absorb the three years and $34 million left on Hedo Turkoglu’s contract.\\n\\nHaha, so basically we would have to give up our ENTIRE future in Curry (Monta is obviously not our future) AND take on Turkoglu's shitty contract, a player who has struggled in multiple seasons recently, as soon as he got that shiny new contract from the idiotic Craptors. Oh yeah, and we would have no draft picks for a few years. All for PART of a lockout-shortened season from Dwight. Great idea Warriors.\\n\\n~~&gt;And the bottom line is this: Should Golden State make a deal for Howard, he would have to take $30 million less over the length of a contract extension to leave this summer.~~\\n\\n~~Oh yeah, I forgot, not only does Dwight NOT want to win a championship with the Warriors, he wants to take less money to not win a championship. Great idea Warriors!~~\\n\\nEdit: JasonQG pointed out to me that this quote might mean:\\n\\n&gt;If the Warriors trade for him, they'd be able to go over the salary cap to re-sign him. As a free agent on the open market, other teams would be restricted by their free cap space.\\n\\nI think he might be right, but that still wouldn't change the fact that Dwight wouldn't re-sign with the Warriors.\\n\\nI sincerely hope davidjsc is right and we are just driving up the price for other suitors.

Regardless, the ankle thing just makes the trade less likely to happen (hopefully), which is good. I also dislike Monta and Curry being mentioned in every trade talk, but I guess that's what we get in our 24/7 sports news cycle.

There's something to be said about those GSW fans.  Plus, there's the money factor.  To me, it's worth the gamble.\\n\\nAnd if there was any cap space left, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to think that some other superstar might want to come join Howard (Deron Williams, for example).\\n\\nAnd hey, if they pull of the trade, and towards the end of the season it's looking like he hates the place, maybe the Warriors can trade him away too.\",\n",

I would like to be optimistic that if we got Dwight he would stay here, but I've been burned too many times as a Warriors fan to truly believe that. If I was Dwight, I would want to win a championship before I got too old. I guess money could be a factor, but winning seems really important to most NBA players, including Dwight, and I just don't think we'd be competing for a championship soon enough for him. And if it looks like he's leaving, I think it would be difficult to trade him for anything towards the end of the season because whatever team will know that they can either get him in free agency anyways or they'll lose him at the end of the season as well. But, *if* they actually do this trade, I guess I can hope for the best. But it would just be extremely depressing to me if they included Curry in the trade. Monta, I would mind less, but would still think it was a bad trade for us.\",\n",

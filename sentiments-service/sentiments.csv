But we woulda been ass blasted by the pissed off Bucks, Wolves and Clippers anyway. Wizards loss was bad but since we depend on shooting only, we can lose to anyone.;In other words, the Bucks don't bother to defend or play hard until.the 4Q, cos they  relatively have the same offensive rating in 4Q as other quarters but their defensive rating becomes top 5;i legit got downvoted for saying that i would still take Curry and Shai over him after people overreacted when they beat the Bucks in the IST;We suck so bad the Bucks commentators have resorted to talking about Wemby’s choice in beanies.;I feel guilty Dame did that in a Bucks jersey"
Draymond Green|"Ok so Brook Lopez can block really well, but can he tech out of Draymond's grabs?;[Vorkunov] Joe Dumars, head of basketball operations for the NBA, on Draymond Green's suspension: ""Only thing we really want to see him do is get better so when he comes back, we’re not dealing with the same issues over and over again. And so that was the whole purpose behind indefinite"";There is a lot of humanity and empathy in what Dumars is saying. It is better than the league just slapping Dray with fines and games, it’s nice to see them care about People and not just Product. But Draymond is also missing game checks “indefinitely”, and this idea of him being “better” is very arbitrary. Seems like the league is setting themselves up to fail here;Want to preface this comment by saying that Draymond is an ass for sure, full stop.

The ""get better"" thing seems to be misconstrued by a good deal of people to mean that he's psychotic, or ""crazy,"" or whatever else. Just want to drop some anecdotal context, as someone who has had severe anger issues my whole life.

Therapy & help aren't just for mentally ill/addicted/crazy people. It really is a valuable tool in learning how to handle your emotions and responses to certain stimuli better. It's helped me a ton in my personal life, and even though I still get more irritated than I should at stuff, I can recognize it quicker before I have a knee-jerk response to shit and end up in a fight or something without thinking about my actions.

I think that's what they really imply with the ""needs help"" narrative. The man needs anger management therapy legit. Whether he takes it seriously or makes any progress or not is on him 100% 

Again, he's an asshole and needs to learn how to be less of one, which counseling and therapy can legit help. Would honestly be pretty cool if he had a legit turnaround and came back and just played solid clean basketball for the rest of his career. Not likely with his track record, but hey, it's the holiday season. One can only hope he does :);Just watch, Draymond’s gonna come back from this suspension with a rebrand as Meta Universe Peace.;You can tell how insecure Shaq is about his own playing career when he gets all defensive like this. He's not defending Draymond here, he's defending himself. 

He sees people critiquing Draymond for the things he's done as direct attacks at his own actions in the past. Why he feels the need to constantly remind people how good he was, or how he's the best big man of all time and he has authority over that position, or how he would choke out Gobert like Draymond did because he's just ""protecting his teammate,"" I'll never know.;You can tell how insecure Shaq is about his own playing career when he gets all defensive like this.

The Warriors stopped by my parent’s restaurant after a loss in the Klay/Steph injury season. It’s a farm-to-table type spot with your standard seating and then one large community table but not really that big and they didn’t make a reservation so there wasn’t enough seats to put them together as an entire party. Vibes were a little off so I think they just wanted to sit down regardless so most of the players got seats together but Draymond, Damian Lee, and some of the coaches sat with strangers at the large table. My dad was waiting them and apparently they were super talkative, everyone was drinking together, and Dray even covered everyone’s tab at the table. My dad even said every time he walked by, Dray would hit him with an open-mouth smile, wink, and palm his butt and really just made everyone feel at home.;Obviously Draymond has some anger/ego issues but just want to remind people that he’s still a human.

He’s friends with so many dudes they completely bypass his behavior on court. But chat just doesn’t wanna listen to that;I think shaq has the majority correct, he's just drawing the wrong conclusion. Draymond doesn't need counseling (in the vein of people struggling with addiction, anxiety, depression)(also I think most if not all people could benefit from counseling, but that's not what we're talking about). However shaq moves to SO ITS OK. It's not ok. Draymond is a flailing child who needs consequences.;Showing support for Draymond.;Just trade for Draymond if you want a teammate to punch you before the game;“He keeps us safe from Draymond”;[Charania] Warriors' four-time NBA champion Draymond Green has started counseling process and is expected to remain sidelined via suspension for at least the next three weeks, sources say.;Next week's tweet:

\[Charania\] Draymond Green's counselor sidelined for the remainder of the season following altercation with the Warriors' four-time champion, sources say.;It's silly to me that Draymond getting therapy is the central frame to his suspension. Like I don't think most people see Draymond act a fool and go ""get this guy into therapy!"". Feels like a completely disingenuous way to talk about this. 

It's such a do-nothing part of this. I could be wrong and this could be what ""changes"" him but I doubt it. Him getting therapy is not the main story here and it's pretty lame that NBA media is going to gift wrap him this scapegoat. He's just going to come out of this and say ""yeah that was too far but I'm better now. Didn't you read that I went to therapy?"" and the media will drop it until he does something again.;It's silly to me that Draymond getting therapy is the central frame to his suspension.

Kendrick Perkins isn’t the king of accurate takes but when he pointed this out and insinuated that the NBA was treating Draymond like a victim, he was spot on.;Incoming Metta Draymond Peace."|"Shaq is not giving up his Draymond take.;Badboys Pistons' Joe Dumars is tired of the in-game violence, that should tell a lot about Draymond's behavior lmao.;For those who don’t know, Dumars was Draymond’s mentor growing up in Michigan - they’re extremely close and he’s often referred to as a father figure by Draymond himself.

Makes sense he’s addressing the emotional side of it and healing perspective. 

Still, I wonder if other players who Dumars didn’t have a relationship with would’ve received harsher punishment than this;For those who don’t know, Dumars was Draymond’s mentor growing up in Michigan - they’re extremely close and he’s often referred to as a father figure by Draymond himself.

This takes the pressure off the league being too long or too short. When Draymond feels he's ready, he can come back. But that also puts all the pressure back on him. If this happens again, there is NO solution. No amount of games is going to fix him. So instead of this happening over and over, this will be it. Draymond can't play in the NBA. That's what the league is doing. Incredibly smart IMHO.;IOW - Draymond decides the length. This takes the pressure off the league being too long or too short.

He has a noted history of being an extremely dirty player. If you are some dumb fuck that says ""Draymond plays like they did in the 80s,"" then, one, you are dumb. But, two, Green can join every single one of those players that played in the 80s and watch games on TV.;The way Ernie initially says “uh, seek counseling” is I’m gonna say 

outstanding.  

And Shaq is actually right to an extent. Draymond isn’t mentally ill. He’s just a dipshit slap machine on the court; he isn’t doing that to people on the street. He isn’t a domestic abuser or anything, so we should keep that in perspective. That sounds like a low bar but in sports it isn’t, sadly. 

The problem is Shaq is excusing it as being just rough on the court when Draymond is straight up attacking people. He’s not being defensive, he’s being aggressive.;The way Ernie initially says “uh, seek counseling” is I’m gonna say

However, this is the same dude who punched Alvin Robertson in his face during a game and punched Eric Montross (RIP) during a game. Charles Barkley would've whipped his ass in '97 because he didn't back down like most did with Shaq. Draymond is too aggressive for today's NBA.

It was like I paid for some seats tonight. I’m happy to be on this side of him being hot. I’ve seen it a lot being on the opposing team. But tonight it was amazing to watch.”;Amazing synergy between these two; Kawhi doesn't have to handle the ball as much, and Harden knows how to get it to him (and PG) where they want. I've also never seen James so engaged on defense since his early Rockets/OKC days.

You said, ‘They didn’t hand me the reins.’ You’re the point guard, you were holding the reins. And what did you do when you had the reins? You scored 9 points in Game 7 against Boston, you blew a 3-2 series lead.

> So they fired their coach, not good enough. You broke up with your guy who believed in you again. You said, ‘The bright lights of LA, that’s where I want to go.’ Let’s see how that works.

> Listen, James, have you ever had those friends who had bad roommates, over and over they complained about their bad roommates. ... They never thought to be self aware enough that they’re the bad roommate. They’re the problem. Hey, James, you’re the problem.

> If this doesn’t work this year in this system with this team, then you’re going to go and point fingers at everybody else and you’re going to go back home and start swiping right for another team, and there’s not going to be anybody left. Because, James, you’re not the beard, you’re not the system, you’re the problem.”"|"

James Harden|"It was a great pick up until Theis stepped on Harden's hand when he was doing snow angels.;I get the joke. 

But, yeah. Overall, it's why I told people to not hate on the Harden trade. The Clippers gave up NOTHING to get him. NOTHING.

It was free money.

Like before the trade, the entire season depends on Kawhi and PG being healthy and performing near their known level. 2023-2024 Harden isn't a #1, but he can be a damn good #3 option for a good team.;I get the joke.

Like before the trade, the entire season depends on Kawhi and PG being healthy and performing near their known level. 2023-2024 Harden isn't a #1, but he can be a damn good #3 option for a good team.;I miss the way Theis used to screen and roll, I don’t see anyone else one else doing it like him, he’d set the screen, stay basket-side of the big while rolling to the rim and sealing the lane for the ball handler to attack downhill. Worked amazing with Tatum, makes sense it’d be a good fit with a guys like Harden PG and Kawhi;The Clippers seem to be a good organization. They were able to make it work with Westbrook and James Harden. That's no easy task from coaching either;[Linn] Kawhi Leonard on James Harden tonight: “It was very entertaining. It was like I paid for some seats tonight. I’m happy to be on this side of him being hot. I’ve seen it a lot being on the opposing team. But tonight it was amazing to watch.”;Harden dropped 21 points in 6 mins during that 4th qrt run

Edit: Kawhi and PG were having way too much fun

https://twitter.com/JeanneZelasko/status/1736932829425009100;Amazing synergy between these two; Kawhi doesn't have to handle the ball as much, and Harden knows how to get it to him (and PG) where they want. I've also never seen James so engaged on defense since his early Rockets/OKC days. Playing with Kawhi has done wonders for him so far.;>It was like I paid for some seats tonight

No quote in history has better summed up the Harden teammate experience;Harden's got Kawhi jumping up and down on the sidelines like Bazemore.;James Harden was in his bag tonight in a win against the Indiana Pacers: 28 MINS │ 35 PTS │ 3 REB │ 9 AST │ 1 STL │ 1 BLK │ 12-16 FG │ 8-11 3P │ 3-3 FT │ +32;About to be 13-3 since the lineup change and Russ benching, Kawhi averaging 26/6/3 on 56/45/91 splits since, Harden averaging 18/5/9 on 48/46/84 splits since as well.

And finally their offense is fully back as well. They have dominated because their defense has been top 2-3 for last 16 games, but now their offense is clicking on best in the league level. That's a scary proposition.

I wanna meet the doomers lol, those who wrote obituaries for this team after the first 5 games already.;I was looking at the box score and was like that can’t be right. What is going on lmao. Had to put on the stream to catch the last part of that sequence. Chef Harden is back.;Thank god this Harden didn’t show up for all 7 games last playoffs, what the fuck;Harden is fun to watch when he's heating up.;[Highlight] Russell Westbrook celebrating James Harden cooking in the 4th quarter!;The team that I most want to win a championship is LA clippers. Harden, Westbrook and PG are legends of the game and deserve it. The franchise deserves it too.;If we cant win a ring this year, I really want this Clippers team to win it. I would be so happy for PG, Russ, Harden;Good to see Chef Harden again;Wait for when playoff Harden shows up…that guy loves fishing.;[Highlight] James Harden scores 18 straight points for the Clippers!;Harden 35 points on 16 shots.. now he is putting 48.5% fg 44% 3 point line… his 17.5 ppg is the most efficient he has been.. As talented as the nba talent pool is Harden is definitely being selected to allstar team if he continues yes playing snd clippers keep winning;Kawhi in the first and Harden in the last could not miss.;Virtuoso! What a performance by Harden!;Zach Lowe said Harden should come off the bench LMAO

They really said he was the problem 😭 oh he's a fuckin problem alright;It’s so beautiful. I have tears of joy.

Teams have to deal with the Kawhi & PG onslaught, and then they still have to face a third option Harden and a relentless Russ. I don’t know the last time I’ve seen this kind of offensive firepower combined with amazing defense (garbage time def inflated the Pacers game total). 

Also lmao the Pacers tried so hard to inflate the score at the end of the fourth.;Kinda of biased to say this as a Harden stan, but its such a joy to see him play;A healthy Kawhi is so fun to watch also that Harden takeover was amazing;For someone who's ""washed"" it seems Harden is still quite good;This Harden guy is pretty good;Observations: Washed Harden still the best iso player. Mavs Offense is just give it to Luka or Kyrie and inshallah. Cam Thomas is Lou Williams reincarnation.;Current Clippers are probably one of the best all-time ISO scoring teams: Kawhi, PG, Harden and Powell. Sometimes in games with not a lot of pace it's literally their whole offense.;Harden showed him who the true Point God is;9-1 since they finally chose to run the offense through Harden.

But to be fair, the Clippers have played some mediocre to bad defenses during the stretch.  Nugs at 12th was the highest, next was GSW at 14th.;""Recently got the trade he wanted"" Harden is one of the best players of all time;He was memed about being in Harden shape not because we’re haters but because we’ve seen it time and time again."|"

Karl-Anthony Towns|I know Edwards has been getting so much of the hype for Minnesota, and he’s been great especially for a 22 year old, but Edwards is actually slightly below league average efficiency so far this year. Minnesota’s strength has been the ridiculous frontcourt of KAT/Rudy/Reid, which is putting up a combined 48.4 ppg on 63% true shooting. Towns himself has been instrumental in making those lineups work. They’d still be a very good team without him, but he’s the cherry on top that’s been an absolute matchup nightmare for teams at the 4. The fact that he doesn’t have to force anything has turned him into such a lethal luxury.|"

Jimmy Butler|"People calling KAT soft largely stems from the Jimmy saga, and that hate is still prolific like you see in this thread. It gets brought up every time KAT has a bad game,  says something corny, or when the Wolves play the Heat. 

Finding an elite player in Ant that actually supports KAT, plays along side his strengths, and can be a leader in ways KAT couldn't fulfill is huge for this fanbase. Instead of needing to fight with trolls on the internet to defend KAT, you can see his play and our team dynamics do all the talking. Something that could never happen in the Jimmy-Wolves era.;After all the ""Jimmy was right"" talk over the past couple years it would be hilarious if the Wolves now win a ring before Jimmy does lol;After all the ""Jimmy was right"" talk over the past couple years it would be hilarious if the Wolves now win a ring before Jimmy does lol;Honestly? I bet Jimmy is proud of KAT for that.;Love to see Jimmy getting punked like that;Pretty hilarious Jimmy said ""we cant win without him"" and a 21 yr old ANT has owned him in matchups ever since including tonight after he bricked the game tying 3 and ANT daggered his old ringless ass at the other end with the MJ-esque fade off the glass. Poetic justice for Wolves fans.;Would be hilarious if KAT wins a championship before Jimmy.;No wonder Jimmy ducks the Wolves lmao;Jimmy should have sat like he did first game, instead he looks like a clown😂"|"

They're a weird team built around their unique skillset.;[Post Game Thread] The New York Knicks (15-11) defeat the Los Angeles Lakers (15-12), 114 - 109;[Post Game Thread] The New York Knicks (15-11) defeat the Los Angeles Lakers (15-12), 114 - 109;[Post Game Thread] The New York Knicks (15-11) defeat the Los Angeles Lakers (15-12), 114 - 109;The in season tournament killed the Pacers and Lakers. 2-7 combined since;The Lakers being considered a top team is lauaghable.

Rudy Gobert|"Still want the Rudy eight pack for one of these wins;Was he actually a PF this whole time?? Seriously, he is so much better at moving laterally than challenging players are the rim. Its like Rudy is his ideal pairing.;I live in MN, and this Wolves team is so much fun to watch. And the excitement is spreading - I’ve seen more Wolves gear in the office over the last month than the last 5 years combined. 

Tim Connelly is one of the best GMs in the league. It’s funny how everyone trashed the trade for Gobert, but he’s been great and is a likely DPOY;D-Epm is a great stat

finally validated in my opinion that Goga Bitadze is a better defender than Embiid, Mobley Gobert and Davis

also always knew max strus was better than mikal bridges;Brook vs JJJ last year, Brook v Gobert this year. Hopefully one of these years he’ll be crowned DPOY.;Have we come to the conclusion that we don't know shit about team building after they made that trade for Rudy?;You can tell how insecure Shaq is about his own playing career when he gets all defensive like this. He's not defending Draymond here, he's defending himself. 

He sees people critiquing Draymond for the things he's done as direct attacks at his own actions in the past. Why he feels the need to constantly remind people how good he was, or how he's the best big man of all time and he has authority over that position, or how he would choke out Gobert like Draymond did because he's just ""protecting his teammate,"" I'll never know.;The original clip had more replays (originally, it was 5 minutes). Including Butler's foul on KAT before KAT made his clutch shot after 1v1 him, replay of the Heat's play that led to Butler's missed shot and Gobert's rebound.

I had to cut a lot in order to reach the 250 MB by Streamable (keeping the high quality of the video), but I think it's still went out okay.;Yeah our fourth quarter problems are obvious at this point, and it gets even more glaring against the best defense in the league that was ramping it up (especially Gobert)

Still, it was good to have Tyler and Bam back, I thought both of them played pretty well when accounting for rush and such.  I do think it was a bit of a strange call not to give Orlando some runtime, especially against the Wolves’ size which was killing us particularly in those non Bam minutes.

Ah well, it was a fun game, on to the next.  GG Wolves.;Rudy won DPOY tonight.;Rudy straight up son'd Bam down the stretch.

Shoutout Alexander-Walker. He was so good in the second half.

I gotta say.. there's something special going on with this team. When You see KAT smiling in crunch time, you feel like they want these big moments.;If we keep this up, Gobert should legitimately win MVP.;This Gobert trade kind looking like a brilliant move by the Wolves;It's still Rudy to be honest.

Chet and Victor are both very impressive defensive prospects though.;Trying to compare blocks with Rudy Gobert is a fraught exercise. 

Not to take anything away from them because they’re all great defenders, but reason these young guys like Chet or Wemby or even Kessler are getting as many blocks as they do is because offenses are still attempting a lot of shots at the rim. And they do an amazing job defending them, I’m not saying that they don’t. 

Rudy is so good that people just don’t even attempt shots in the paint. I wish there was a stat to quantify it, but the number of times a player goes into the paint, faces up Rudy, and immediately passes out is insane. His rim deterrence and shot blocking are so otherworldly that he suppresses his own block stats because teams just aren’t even attempting shots on him.;Trying to compare blocks with Rudy Gobert is a fraught exercise.

He might have an outside shot for second team though. Gobert is still the guy to beat right now for Chet and Wemby.

I am excited at the prospect of Chet and Jalen Suggs being on the All Defense team together in the future. Two Minnesota high school friends, two former Zags, and two guys that approach defense with a rare intensity for them both being so young.;Rudy has bagged it this season, but I wouldn't be surprised to see him or Wemby be the favourite to win it next season.;Gobert won the game

Denver Nuggets|"Theis is a beast and the only reason he couldn't play consistently for the Celtics was that the refs really hated him. They'd allow physical games but then call Theis for moving screens or touch fouls, it was insane. 

He's a fantastic player. Denver - Clippers will be an interesting WCF;Obviously this isn't the Mavs' actual full roster but the fact that Jokic can just do cardio with Luka giving 110% and Denver still wins by 30 is hilarious lol;I thought the Wolves mainly had to worry about Denver and perhaps less so about 4 other teams.

But I did not have the Clippers kicking everyone's ass on my bingo card.

A healthy Kawhi is good for the league but not good for my mental health haha.   That guy is a killer when he is healthy.;The Nuggets won by 26 in a night where Jamal and AG were actively laughing at the idea of giving Jokic the ball. What a performance."|"

I.e. the Knicks in past years, the Blazers, etc. 

It sucks to be bad, but the Rockets should have embraced it for longer. Instead they suffer in mediocrity with hopes that exceed their abilities. 

Of course the rockets shouldn’t be buyers at the deadline! The fact that this is news means that they have been approaching it wrong lol.

If you want vets for team culture, great. But you shouldn’t blow your wad this early in a half assed attempt to compete 🤦🏼‍♂️;iHart's value is going to go through the roof during this stretch while Robinson is out.

Impending free agent and the Knicks don't have his Bird rights."|"

Clips were clicking against the Knicks too but they have the 17th adjusted defensive rating in the league.

In their last 16 games, the Clips have only faced one top 10 defense and that was the Rockets when the Rockets were on the road where they are much worse than at home.

Clips play another mediocre defense next in Dallas.  Then they get a real test.  OKC at OKC on the 2nd half of a b2b, then Boston in LA.  Those games ought to tell us a lot more about these Clippers."

I’m telling you in advance, you’re welcome for the wisdom I’m about to spew. Because, listen, I get on my knees every night and pray for someone to believe in me like Daryl Morey believed in you.

> You wanted a certain coach, they brought in Mike D’Antoni. You wanted to play a certain style, they played it. You wanted Dwight Howard, they brought him in and got rid of him when you were tired of him. You wanted Chris Paul, they brought him in and got rid of him when you were tired of him. They brought in your old friend Russell Westbrook.

> You wanted to go to Vegas on off days, they looked away. You wanted the team to stay over so you could go out at night, they changed the schedule. And it didn’t work, and you know what, you said I’m gonna break up with my woobie, not good enough. I see the bright lights in New York, I want to go there [with] my old pal Kevin Durant. It’s gonna work, the big three. And all after one year, you wanted out. You realized, oh my gosh, I took this guy for granted, the guy that believed in me. I want to go back with Daryl Morey. They traded Ben Simmons for you, how did they pull that off?

> And you know what, you went there and got a partner who got the MVP. He won the MVP and what did you say afterwards? You said, ‘They didn’t hand me the reins.’ You’re the point guard, you were holding the reins. And what did you do when you had the reins? You scored 9 points in Game 7 against Boston, you blew a 3-2 series lead.

> So they fired their coach, not good enough. You broke up with your guy who believed in you again. You said, ‘The bright lights of LA, that’s where I want to go.’ Let’s see how that works.

> Listen, James, have you ever had those friends who had bad roommates, over and over they complained about their bad roommates. ... They never thought to be self aware enough that they’re the bad roommate. They’re the problem. Hey, James, you’re the problem.

> If this doesn’t work this year in this system with this team, then you’re going to go and point fingers at everybody else and you’re going to go back home and start swiping right for another team, and there’s not going to be anybody left. Because, James, you’re not the beard, you’re not the system, you’re the problem.”;[Rahbar] Chet Holmgren included Thunder director of security Paul Huggins in his postgame interview(on the court). “He keeps us safe every day.

RJ Barrett|Depends what your read on Mitchell is and what you can get. If you think there’s a real chance he re-signs, you play the season out. If the best you can do in a trade is like RJ, Quickley and 2 1sts, you play out the season because you can probably get something similar over the summer. If you think he’s gone/ the season gets side ways  and you get a bidding war, you probably look to trade him.|
Kawhi Leonard|"I get the joke. 

But, yeah. Overall, it's why I told people to not hate on the Harden trade. The Clippers gave up NOTHING to get him. NOTHING.

It was free money.

Like before the trade, the entire season depends on Kawhi and PG being healthy and performing near their known level. 2023-2024 Harden isn't a #1, but he can be a damn good #3 option for a good team.;I miss the way Theis used to screen and roll, I don’t see anyone else one else doing it like him, he’d set the screen, stay basket-side of the big while rolling to the rim and sealing the lane for the ball handler to attack downhill. Worked amazing with Tatum, makes sense it’d be a good fit with a guys like Harden PG and Kawhi;Kawhi happier than when he won his last finals MVP 🤣;[Linn] Kawhi Leonard on James Harden tonight: “It was very entertaining. It was like I paid for some seats tonight. I’m happy to be on this side of him being hot. I’ve seen it a lot being on the opposing team. But tonight it was amazing to watch.”;Harden dropped 21 points in 6 mins during that 4th qrt run

Edit: Kawhi and PG were having way too much fun

https://twitter.com/JeanneZelasko/status/1736932829425009100;This doesn’t even sound like something Kawhi would say lol;Kawhi wasn't giving answers like this before lmao, he loves harden. He's also looked way more hyped on the court since they got harden;Amazing synergy between these two; Kawhi doesn't have to handle the ball as much, and Harden knows how to get it to him (and PG) where they want. I've also never seen James so engaged on defense since his early Rockets/OKC days. Playing with Kawhi has done wonders for him so far.;Amazing synergy between these two; Kawhi doesn't have to handle the ball as much, and Harden knows how to get it to him (and PG) where they want. I've also never seen James so engaged on defense since his early Rockets/OKC days. Playing with Kawhi has done wonders for him so far.;Harden's got Kawhi jumping up and down on the sidelines like Bazemore.;> I'm happy to be on this side of him being hot. 

Uh.. pause there for a moment Kawhi.;I've never seen Kawhi this happy lol what a quick turnaround to what looked bad initially does to a mf;Is that most sentences Kawhi has used at one time?;About to be 13-3 since the lineup change and Russ benching, Kawhi averaging 26/6/3 on 56/45/91 splits since, Harden averaging 18/5/9 on 48/46/84 splits since as well.

And finally their offense is fully back as well. They have dominated because their defense has been top 2-3 for last 16 games, but now their offense is clicking on best in the league level. That's a scary proposition.

I wanna meet the doomers lol, those who wrote obituaries for this team after the first 5 games already.;Had Kawhi showing emotions thats how good he was;Kawhi in the first and Harden in the last could not miss.;Kawhi benched in the 4th, truly washed;You got harden making snow angels on the court and Kawhi hitting like 60% of his shots LMFAOO. 

Please God let this team stay fully healthy PLZ. We have been denied long enough!;It’s so beautiful. I have tears of joy.

Teams have to deal with the Kawhi & PG onslaught, and then they still have to face a third option Harden and a relentless Russ. I don’t know the last time I’ve seen this kind of offensive firepower combined with amazing defense (garbage time def inflated the Pacers game total). 

Also lmao the Pacers tried so hard to inflate the score at the end of the fourth.;A healthy Kawhi is so fun to watch also that Harden takeover was amazing;I thought the Wolves mainly had to worry about Denver and perhaps less so about 4 other teams.

But I did not have the Clippers kicking everyone's ass on my bingo card.

A healthy Kawhi is good for the league but not good for my mental health haha.   That guy is a killer when he is healthy.;Current Clippers are probably one of the best all-time ISO scoring teams: Kawhi, PG, Harden and Powell. Sometimes in games with not a lot of pace it's literally their whole offense.;Kawhi Leonard continues his hot streak in a win against the Pacers: 26 MINS │ 28 PTS │ 2 REB │ 1 AST │ 1 STL │ 12-18 FG │ 2-5 3P │ 2-2 FT │ +27"|"There's several players right now who could make it:

Damian Lillard|Damian Lillard is 6 points away from 20,000 in his career — he will become the 51st player in NBA history to reach this milestone;Obviously Draymond has some anger/ego issues but just want to remind people that he’s still a human. The Warriors stopped by my parent’s restaurant after a loss in the Klay/Steph injury season. It’s a farm-to-table type spot with your standard seating and then one large community table but not really that big and they didn’t make a reservation so there wasn’t enough seats to put them together as an entire party. Vibes were a little off so I think they just wanted to sit down regardless so most of the players got seats together but Draymond, Damian Lee, and some of the coaches sat with strangers at the large table. My dad was waiting them and apparently they were super talkative, everyone was drinking together, and Dray even covered everyone’s tab at the table. My dad even said every time he walked by, Dray would hit him with an open-mouth smile, wink, and palm his butt and really just made everyone feel at home.;I was told the heat don’t need a closer like Lillard 🤔|

Klay Thompson|"Surprised Klay Thompson doesn’t have 15k all time;He's probably the only guy in the league who's been the primary defender on Steph Curry and Victor Wembanyama this year.  He's consistently guarding the best offensive player this year, so long as it's not a post player.  That to me says more than EPM.

Still, it was good to have Tyler and Bam back, I thought both of them played pretty well when accounting for rush and such.  I do think it was a bit of a strange call not to give Orlando some runtime, especially against the Wolves’ size which was killing us particularly in those non Bam minutes.

Chet Holmgren|"Shai is first in the league in STL% and Chet is first in the league in BLK%. You love to see it.;What's great to see about this is that unlike the old days when Russ would gamble in the passing lanes and rack up relatively gaudy steal numbers, this is all backed by sound defensive activity. 

The defense is built on a rotation-heavy ethos that relies on length to contest heavily and try to push teams into overpassing, with Chet as a safety blanket inside if they manage to get a driving lane going. On top of raw steals, SGA is leading the league in deflections , loose balls recovered, and contested threes per game. 

He's not a traditional individual lockdown defender but his ability to seamlessly switch across the perimeter, play free safety in the passing lanes, and general effort level have been huge in setting the defensive tone. Especially given his offensive responsibilities, would be easy to shirk on that end but he leads very much by example.;Damn and Chet has 33 in December. Wonder what Wemby has. Leauge is in good hands;Referees tried to take two of his blocks away but Mark Daigneault won both challenges lol, eventually they have to start giving Holmgren the benefit of the doubt. He has elite IQ and anticipation, he's also very discipline at staying vertical. It's crazy he's a rookie and this good already.;It’s a shame that once ROTY is announced the main talking point will be how the other guy shoulda won because it’s unreal what both Wemby & Holmgren are doing;[Botkin] Thunder rookie Chet Holmgren throws another seven-block party as DPOY buzz continues to grow;[Botkin] Thunder rookie Chet Holmgren throws another seven-block party as DPOY buzz continues to grow;It's still Rudy to be honest.

Chet and Victor are both very impressive defensive prospects though.;Trying to compare blocks with Rudy Gobert is a fraught exercise. 

Not to take anything away from them because they’re all great defenders, but reason these young guys like Chet or Wemby or even Kessler are getting as many blocks as they do is because offenses are still attempting a lot of shots at the rim. And they do an amazing job defending them, I’m not saying that they don’t. 

Rudy is so good that people just don’t even attempt shots in the paint. I wish there was a stat to quantify it, but the number of times a player goes into the paint, faces up Rudy, and immediately passes out is insane. His rim deterrence and shot blocking are so otherworldly that he suppresses his own block stats because teams just aren’t even attempting shots on him.;I honestly don't understand why people are still going at Chet.;I don’t think Chet has a shot this year. He might have an outside shot for second team though. Gobert is still the guy to beat right now for Chet and Wemby.

I am excited at the prospect of Chet and Jalen Suggs being on the All Defense team together in the future.

I’m so sick of this shit man it makes watching basketball not as fun as it should be;The biggest thing working against the Cavs is that Mitchell isn't supermax eligible because they traded for him after his rookie deal. Because of that they can only offer him a slightly higher raise each year and a 5th guaranteed year over other teams. If they could offer him the supermax I'd be more confident in them keeping him but without that trading him in the offseason seems the most likely option if he doesn't extend. But I doubt they trade him before he rejects the extension.;This team still has a young core that is growing and developing
far from a Chip or bust team.

DG, Mobley, even JA, and Emoni. 

and we added shooting and grit in Niang and Strus. not to mention DWade starting to step it up now that he's healthy (knocking on that wood).

He's the old Russ quote about ""Pat Bev trick y'all man he run around but he don't guard nobody"" but unironically lol

- *Pacers lose a regular season game against a team that's not in their conference:* The Pacers have ""come back down to earth"", Hali's overrated etc

Let's put this in perspective. Hali had a bad game and his team got blown out. That doesn't mean he's the worst PG in the league, he's still a good player. Steph couldn't hit a 3 pointer against the Blazers. That doesn't mean he's no longer the greatest shooter in the NBA history.

Mavs Offense is just give it to Luka or Kyrie and inshallah. Cam Thomas is Lou Williams reincarnation.;Jokic with 8/9/7 and he doesn't have to worry about his team winning. Imagine Luka having that kinda privilege. He has to put up MVP numbers for us to not look like a lottery team;Luka -29 in a great game. Get him some help.;Luka is in a similar arc to Joker 2 years ago. Mavs missed so many wide open 3s from great passes. MVP frontrunner for sure.;Luka playing nearly three straight quarters in the mile high wasn’t a winning strategy. Took a double digit lead and coasted.;There's a grand total of 0 people on this team that can create their own shot other than Luka...|"Damn the clippers have the two most efficient and 3 in the top 10 is crazy.

Luka and Kyrie combines for over 10 a game is also crazy;Mavs offense is watching Luka eat and every one else gets the scraps"
Duncan Robinson|Can we appreciate a young man using the board off a spin like this to put in the late game dagger? MJ and Duncan would be proud.|He’s the first rookie since Tim Duncan in 1998 to have back-to-back games of 7+ blocks.;First rookie since Duncan in 98 to have 6+ blocks 2 games in a row
Kobe Bufkin|Yep, Kobe was definitely not reason why the dynasty died. I used to think it was him, but Shaq has revealed himself to be a petty nephew with takes like this.|Damn, that's the most MJ-esque thing I've seen since Kobe. And just the other day I was thinking how SGA was the most aesthetically similar.

I’ve seen it a lot being on the opposing team. But tonight it was amazing to watch.”;My goodness. Leonard a little chatty Kathy here.;Leonard that happy made my entire year;Kawhi Leonard continues his hot streak in a win against the Pacers: 26 MINS │ 28 PTS │ 2 REB │ 1 AST │ 1 STL │ 12-18 FG │ 2-5 3P │ 2-2 FT │ +27;They've been great. I'm not sure if I'm ready to call them contenders yet, but it is cool to see him and Leonard playing well|
Ty Jerome|Ty Lue is still an underrated coach|
Saben Lee|Obviously Draymond has some anger/ego issues but just want to remind people that he’s still a human. The Warriors stopped by my parent’s restaurant after a loss in the Klay/Steph injury season. It’s a farm-to-table type spot with your standard seating and then one large community table but not really that big and they didn’t make a reservation so there wasn’t enough seats to put them together as an entire party. Vibes were a little off so I think they just wanted to sit down regardless so most of the players got seats together but Draymond, Damian Lee, and some of the coaches sat with strangers at the large table. My dad was waiting them and apparently they were super talkative, everyone was drinking together, and Dray even covered everyone’s tab at the table. My dad even said every time he walked by, Dray would hit him with an open-mouth smile, wink, and palm his butt and really just made everyone feel at home.|
Eric Gordon||Here's the thing about Shaq's take, he was right about Draymond not needing counseling off the court. However, this is the same dude who punched Alvin Robertson in his face during a game and punched Eric Montross (RIP) during a game. Charles Barkley would've whipped his ass in '97 because he didn't back down like most did with Shaq. Draymond is too aggressive for today's NBA. Someone would've smacked his ass in the '90s to straighten him out.
Charles Bediako|Lmao Charles saying not to bet Ja 25+ when that’s his fan duel bet tonight is fucking hilarious.|"Here's the thing about Shaq's take, he was right about Draymond not needing counseling off the court.

Devin Booker|Devin Booker, nascent Point God [OC Analysis];How often do microimprovements like these show up in the playoffs? Personally, I have my doubts we'll see Booker's passing skill be an effective tool against a high level defense but its an enjoyable analysis nonetheless.|As a Mavs fan, I absolutely hate the Sons, but goddam cannot deny Booker's talents. His online trolling overshadows the talent leaps he takes every season.;I remember thinking Booker in his first few years had a limited ceiling because I thought his defense and playmaking were gonna hold him back, but boy was I wrong. You don’t see this kind of development very often from being so terribly defensively to a rather good one, and also from kind of a black hole to having point guard chops.

Still, it was good to have Tyler and Bam back, I thought both of them played pretty well when accounting for rush and such.  I do think it was a bit of a strange call not to give Orlando some runtime, especially against the Wolves’ size which was killing us particularly in those non Bam minutes.

You can read all the Philly horror stories you want but actually dangerous people are too busy worrying about actually dangerous shit.

The NBA is a little more casual so ymmv but with baseball and hockey people are more just stoked to see another actual fan. I've worn PK Subban jerseys to games featuring teams he never played for that led to long discussions about his trade history with complete strangers.

You can read all the Philly horror stories you want but actually dangerous people are too busy worrying about actually dangerous shit.

Lonzo Ball|"Dude was hooping. I think he's gotten a lot better handling & passing the ball. I remember in the Boylin days he would get his pocket picked & turn the ball over constantly.

Whatever it is he's really taken a major step up in improvement."|
Walker Kessler|"Trying to compare blocks with Rudy Gobert is a fraught exercise. 

Not to take anything away from them because they’re all great defenders, but reason these young guys like Chet or Wemby or even Kessler are getting as many blocks as they do is because offenses are still attempting a lot of shots at the rim. And they do an amazing job defending them, I’m not saying that they don’t. 

Rudy is so good that people just don’t even attempt shots in the paint. I wish there was a stat to quantify it, but the number of times a player goes into the paint, faces up Rudy, and immediately passes out is insane. His rim deterrence and shot blocking are so otherworldly that he suppresses his own block stats because teams just aren’t even attempting shots on him."|
Jalen Suggs|"I don’t think Chet has a shot this year. He might have an outside shot for second team though. Gobert is still the guy to beat right now for Chet and Wemby.

I am excited at the prospect of Chet and Jalen Suggs being on the All Defense team together in the future. Two Minnesota high school friends, two former Zags, and two guys that approach defense with a rare intensity for them both being so young."|

I’m telling you in advance, you’re welcome for the wisdom I’m about to spew. Because, listen, I get on my knees every night and pray for someone to believe in me like Daryl Morey believed in you.

> You wanted a certain coach, they brought in Mike D’Antoni. You wanted to play a certain style, they played it. You wanted Dwight Howard, they brought him in and got rid of him when you were tired of him. You wanted Chris Paul, they brought him in and got rid of him when you were tired of him. They brought in your old friend Russell Westbrook.

> You wanted to go to Vegas on off days, they looked away. You wanted the team to stay over so you could go out at night, they changed the schedule. And it didn’t work, and you know what, you said I’m gonna break up with my woobie, not good enough. I see the bright lights in New York, I want to go there [with] my old pal Kevin Durant. It’s gonna work, the big three. And all after one year, you wanted out. You realized, oh my gosh, I took this guy for granted, the guy that believed in me. I want to go back with Daryl Morey. They traded Ben Simmons for you, how did they pull that off?

> And you know what, you went there and got a partner who got the MVP. He won the MVP and what did you say afterwards? You said, ‘They didn’t hand me the reins.’ You’re the point guard, you were holding the reins. And what did you do when you had the reins? You scored 9 points in Game 7 against Boston, you blew a 3-2 series lead.

> So they fired their coach, not good enough. You broke up with your guy who believed in you again. You said, ‘The bright lights of LA, that’s where I want to go.’ Let’s see how that works.

> Listen, James, have you ever had those friends who had bad roommates, over and over they complained about their bad roommates. ... They never thought to be self aware enough that they’re the bad roommate. They’re the problem. Hey, James, you’re the problem.

> If this doesn’t work this year in this system with this team, then you’re going to go and point fingers at everybody else and you’re going to go back home and start swiping right for another team, and there’s not going to be anybody left. Because, James, you’re not the beard, you’re not the system, you’re the problem.”"|
